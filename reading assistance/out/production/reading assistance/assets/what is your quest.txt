Adventure Games
the adventure game genres roots are interwoven from imagined stories cowritten by players around a dinner table gamebooks with �you� as the protagonist, and worlds of interactive fiction. While the label �interactive fiction� would come to be associated primarily with the text parser and the absence of a graphical environment, the spirit of the early terminology (and the connection to gamebooks) would remain essential for defining the adventure game genre, which existed on the outskirts of the accepted definitions of gameplay. As computer games evolved the type of highly on-rails, story-centric gameplay that adventure games represented with their close tie to traditional textuality would be more and more suspect as true interactivity, and the clashing demands of narrative and agency would become more prominent as the expectations of players changed in light of fully realized and exploration-based worlds.  The challenge of creating a truly interactive narrative has been debated in the past (and in my own analysis above) as a problem of balancing the demands of narrative and play. The designer is trying to tell a story, but the more linear and unified that story becomes, the more the player is confined and imprisoned within it, left without agency in the world of the game. Too much freedom, and the player is left wandering without guidance or motivation, and the quest loses its power to motivate the player to progress through the world. As I showed in the previous chapter, the adventure game genre can be considered a descendant of interactive fiction, and is similarly characterized by the dominance of story over gameplay, often with only one �happy� ending. The game involves overcoming obstacles set on the path to reaching that conclusion. In On Interactive Storytelling, Chris Crawford begins by examining the role of storytelling in games. Crawford notes that low expectations on the part of gamers often allow games to escape the actual confines
chapter two 34
of storytelling: Games have never paid much attention to the many structural requirements imposed on stories. . . . Players don�t complain when games jerk them through wild dramatic gyrations because they don�t expect games to follow the protocols of storytelling� (14). This is particularly true of a game such as Doom, in which the vague storyline involves a Mars space marine fighting creatures for reasons that are barely elaborated upon. The plot advances around moving from level to level, but that progression is neither explained nor particularly important. The focus in Doom is on interacting with the game world, but only through using brute combat. Crawford defines interactivity as �a cyclic process between two or more active agents in which each agent alternately listens, thinks, and speaks� (29). Crawford�s definition of interactivity describes an ideal in which the player acts and the game responds to that player�s specific action. The reality of most games even today is that the active participation in this dialogue is limited: the player acts and the game responds in one of the ways that the game designer has programmed it to in anticipation of possible player actions. However, adventure games rely on a conversation that goes beyond the actions of the player within the space: the conversation between player and designer as they collaborate to tell a story. The metaphor Crawford uses for interaction is conversation. This allows him to easily differentiate the experience of the game from an experience such as watching a movie: �Reaction, no matter how intense, is not the same as interaction. If you�re watching a great movie, and your heart is pounding with excitement and your fingers trembling with emotion, you�re still not interacting with the movie because it�s not listening to what you are saying, nor is it thinking about anything� (Crawford 30). This definition echoes Marie-Laure Ryan�s understanding of interactivity as dialogue, a back-and-forth between system and user. Just as in a conversation, the experience of interactivity always depends upon the individual involved: �millions of people can play an interactive storyworld, and each one can experience something that nobody else has ever experienced . . . it responds to each person individually� (36). This level of interactivity is dependent upon a fully realized world, one in which the player�s interactions are more meaningful than simply choosing from a few dialogue options or completing quests to find an object�this idea
adventure games 35
defines a hypothetical ideal while ignoring the strengths of the game genres we already have. In light of these definitions, adventure games might not appear to be much more interactive than Doom. Adventure games succeed not at the limitless interactivity of this pure definition but at the limited interactivity demanded by narrative. Stuart Moulthrop recently addressed the critical history of setting interactivity and narrative at odds: �It has become unfashionable to speak of antipathy between games and stories, after some defining schoolyard moments in which early ludologists faced down their literary harassers, winning a grudgingly respectful truce. Yet there remains a necessary and inevitable tension between these sharply different forms of fiction� (Preface xxi). While Doom�s interactions lack choice, adventure games provide freedom within constraints. The constraints are not arbitrary, and thus they reflect the �tension� Moulthrop noted between story and game: this is not an external tension, but an internal mechanism. However, the interactivity of adventure games is in the opportunity for responsiveness within limits: the tension between narrative and play is used to tell the story. The genre probes the real potential of interactive stories, not as massive productions, but as acts of authorship with the intimacy of oral storytelling. I will briefly examine the history of early adventure gaming alongside some of the theoretical debates over truly interactive narrative, beginning with arguably the first �graphic� adventure game, Mystery House (1980, Apple II), and continuing through the golden age of gaming dominated by rival houses Sierra and LucasArts. Throughout this early history, it is particularly crucial to note the role of the fans and players, who would themselves become the storytellers of future generations of adventure games, even after the genre fell out of favor in the commercial market.
houses of mystery
 When Roberta Williams, one-half of the partnership that would create adventure game titan Sierra On-Line, first encountered the text-based world of interactive fiction, she thought there was something missing. Her solution took the form of Mystery House, the first graphical adventure 
chapter two 36
game, which offered an abstracted Victorian house for the player to explore room by room through command interactions copied from interactive fiction (Williams and Williams). The exterior of the house (fig. 1), with its limited color palette and architectural �3-D� drawing style, demonstrates both the limitations of early graphics and the ability of the designers to create a foreboding atmosphere in spite of them.  Mystery House launched the adventure game genre. Each new game further integrated the words and pictures until full voice-over and mouse interaction removed much of the text from the gameplay. But the stories remained at the center of the games, and even the first game, with its blocky line graphics, did not fall into the forgotten abyss of abandoned digital files. Nick Montfort�s �Mystery House Taken Over� (2004, PC/Mac/Linux, Glux) project preserved the files and substance of Mystery House for reinterpretation and rebirth and is a powerful example of fan/academic intervention in and transformation of even the earliest of graphic adventures. The project included a reimplementation of the original along with ten different transformations ranging from Guy Minor�s revenge tragedy, �Occluded Vengeance,� to Michael Gentry�s surreal �[You wake up itching].�  These many versions made more than two decades after the original, the variety of which can be seen in figure 2, are an invitation to go back

adventure games 37
into the mystery house and discover something new (Montfort, �Mystery House Taken Over�). When contrasted with the original Mystery House, the thumbnails for the remakes show added color, reworked themes, and even full conversions of the underlying engine. One such reworking by noted interactive fiction author Emily Short retitles the story into �Mystery House Possessed,� a text-only game that describes the house in a way that the graphics of the era would never have supported: �Here, to the south, is the house. The paint has peeled off, the candy-like trimming largely fallen away, and all that is left is the structure with its narrow puritan bones plain to see. . . . A wizened tree grows before the house, most of the leaves gone, bearing out of season eight pale blue flowers.� Such remakes demonstrate the enduring potential of one of the most literary genres among games, and constitute a form of creative �modding,� or retelling. Adventure game fans would regularly undertake a similar type of deconstruction and reconstruction with other games as well. While projects like �Mystery House Taken Over� recall the early days of computer graphics, the industry�s shift to graphics was gradual. Initially working within a static visual environment, players continued to input actions through a text parser and act in part as cowriters of the

chapter two 38
game�s story, albeit within the limited vocabulary that the parser could translate into objects or actions. The introduction of the mouse dramatically changed that interaction, permitting clickable text buttons to replace verbs for sparking in-game actions, and eventually by using iconic representations of action choices and direct point-and-click interaction. The introduction of soundtracks and recorded dialogue voice-overs also changed the literary form of the adventure game. These elements demanded less of the player as coauthor, as reading and writing moved from a fundamental method of play to a secondary form, preserved only in games labeled throwbacks to these early genres.
the first adventures
 Soon, the creator of Mystery House was taking graphics in adventure games to the next level. Their next epics incorporated animated visuals in the place of the static graphics of Mystery House, and with each generation the games gained more complexity in dynamic illustration. The era of animated adventure games brought the incorporation of graphics and the avatar to the genre. This was a radical change from the precedent set by interactive fiction, particularly in the evolution of interface. In an animated adventure game, initially the text-based commands remained, but instead of seeing only text description and a basically static image such as that of Mystery House, the player saw a graphical screen of the area the avatar currently occupied. At the next stage of development, the player directly manipulated the avatar. If the player typed the command �go west,� the avatar on the screen went west. When mouse technology made these screens directly clickable, instead of typing the player could point to the place or object in the graphic with which he or she wanted to interact. From these beginnings the two main publishers of classic-era 1980s and 1990s animated adventure games emerged�Sierra and LucasArts. Throughout the 1990s these and other publishers continued to release adventure games, eventually switching from the 2-D cartoon-style graphics of the early games to the 3-D graphics that had become standard throughout the industry. In 1987, Lucasfilm Games�which would soon 
adventure games 39
be renamed LucasArts�released an animated adventure game entitled Maniac Mansion (Commodore 64, Apple II), the first to use a gaming engine LucasArts would refine for most of its adventure game releases. This gaming engine was entitled �Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion� (SCUMM). Designed by Aric Wilmunder and Ron Gilbert, the SCUMM gaming engine allows the easy transfer of an adventure game to multiple platforms, meaning that the game could be played on many of the different models of PCs available at the time without as much difficulty in rewriting the code. The SCUMM interface has a unique character: it places the traditional text-based verb commands for a game environment as options on a menu bar that takes up a third of the screen. This system allows the reader to choose a verb such as �Pick up� and to enact that verb on an object from the game world, such as �Pick up key.� The menu options leave no need for guesswork in determining what actions are possible at any point in the game, giving the player a visual codex revealing the possible interactions with the world. By contrast, the text parser offered players an open point of entry where the limits of interactivity had to be probed to be known. Even as these technical changes altered the game environment, adventure games continued to be story-driven. The goal is to progress through an overarching narrative by solving puzzles. The player controls a character and sees that character through a specific quest by overcoming puzzle- and story-based obstacles that range from finding a key to fit a lock to outwitting a guard at the entrance of a temple. The story-driven portion of this definition is more crucial to understanding this genre than it might be with other forms of computer games. For instance, the first-person shooter (as in the previous example of Doom) often functions on a story-line as simple as �kill the invading aliens� without that being problematic or limiting, whereas the expectation for adventure games is that the story will be an original experience worth revealing through the solving of puzzles: the progression of the story is in effect the reward of the game. However, adventure games cannot simply narrate a story: they somehow have to involve the user in the experience and make him or her part of the narrative development. For the player to care about the game, he or she must first identify with or be interested in the character at the center of the game. The mouse bridges some of the 
chapter two 40
gap between a player�s actions and a character�s actions, enforcing the connection even as the third-person camera view discourages the player from adopting the character�s gaze. The user�s relation with the interface is different in the adventure genre than in other genres of gaming, in part because of the close ties to the text-parser model from interactive fiction. As I pointed out in chapter 1, the emphasis on fighting in most other genres requires a playing style that is closer to the reflex-based games of the arcade than the quests and stories of Dungeons & Dragons. Reflex-based games also use an interface that is based on the point-and-click model, but in an action game or console interface the focus is often on speed and hand-eye coordination�speed is essential, as the environment itself is hostile. In an adventure game, the user is expected to take time to explore the environment and find the elements that make it possible to solve puzzles and advance the story. Quest solutions are not supposed to be immediately obvious but must be discovered through exploration. The text parser made this exploration feel limitless, while the mouse restricts the user to manipulating only what is visually represented. However, the text system only offered the illusion of limitlessness. In reality, the only actions possible in either system are those intended by the designer.  Another important development that proved essential to the adventure game is the integration of game saving as a mechanic. Other early genres and platforms did not require saving: the arcade game, for example, is a public machine. As a public rather than private gaming experience, particularly from its early development, the arcade machine generally does not have a �save game.� Players cannot stop playing and then later pick up where they left off, or save their progress before taking a risky or uncertain action. Instead, usually arcade games are divided by levels, and finishing a level allows the player to learn a pass code to access the next level sometime later. This system emphasizes the generic nature of the experience: it does not matter how the player finishes the previous levels; the next level is the same for everyone and thus can be accessed separately from the player�s own path and identity.  By contrast, the �save game� is an absolute necessity for the adventure game to exist. An adventure game user frustrated in interacting with the game environment has the option to save before taking a risk or 
adventure games 41
to quit the game for a time and take a break�a temporary rather than final ending. As a result, the �save game� allows for progression of a game in more than one sitting�indeed, as Jesper Juul notes, it allows for games lasting hundreds of hours, not just a single sitting as with the arcade games (Half-Real 111). As an adventure game usually features a narrative that moves forward through the action, not having the ability to pick up exactly where the game was left off would make such games impossible. In this light, playing an adventure game is more like reading a book: the player picks up the book on the page where he or she left off rather than beginning at the first page every time. However, that metaphor does not fully apply. A book is always the same from start to finish. A reader might skip from chapter to chapter, or read the ending first, but these activities do not change the linearity of the original text. The only save device generally available in a book is the bookmark, which marks a point in the narrative without consideration for how the reader arrives there. In an adventure game, it is the player�s specific trajectory that must be preserved to allow the finishing of the player�s own story: the experience is not generic, and it is not a question of simply moving on to the next level or chapter.
early avatars
 As the introduction of graphics and the �save game� brought embodied avatars to the adventure game genre, memorable characters started to emerge, built through text, graphics, and interaction. Early avatars relied heavily on stereotypes and familiar archetypes to explore the possibilities of interactive storytelling, often carrying with them the baggage of other genres�primarily books, comics, and film. In most cases, players entering an adventure game know that at the start they will not be able to choose the characteristics of the avatars that will represent them. One of the few exceptions is Maniac Mansion, which offers players multiple predetermined avatars from which to choose. The game follows a familiar plotline: rescue the girl. In this case, the girl is Sandy, a cheerleader who was kidnapped by Dr. Fred Edison, the owner of the mansion. Leading a mission to rescue Sandy is her boyfriend, Dave, but 
chapter two 42
the player has the choice of who accompanies Dave on this perilous task (Gilbert, Maniac Mansion). The available avatars in Maniac Mansion are teenage stereotypes. Choosing among them is not a matter of aesthetics, however, as each character has an impact on the possibilities of gameplay. There are six choices from the group, of which two can be brought on the task: Syd, a musician; Michael, a photographer and the lone person of color (sadly, still notable among computer game avatars from any genre); Wendy, a writer; Bernard, a geek; Razor, another musician and the second female character choice; and Jeff, a surfer. But even though the characters are stereotyped, LucasArts used them to make fun of the stock female characters and plot typical of the ongoing King�s Quest series, created by rival developer Sierra. In Maniac Mansion, the story seems to resemble that of King�s Quest II�man goes to rescue a princess. But in Maniac Mansion, the princess is a cheerleader kidnapped by a mad scientist, and the man doing the rescuing is fairly incompetent at his task. The friends make the plot move forward, not the knight or the princess. It is possible to defeat Maniac Mansion and rescue the cheerleader with any combination of rescuers. Of the choices, however, the most useful is a male, Bernard, pictured in plate 1 in an iconic combination of glasses and collared white shirt. The line of text below the visual image of the mansion�s interior is the limited text parser for processing �sentences� or actions made from the available abilities. Bernard is a geek, capable of repairing all the electronic devices that are broken within the house�his verb �fix� is in the list of options below. His role in the first game is so pivotal that he is the lone playable avatar to return in Maniac Mansion�s sequel, Day of the Tentacle, suggesting a desire for continuity of character identification between the two games as best represented by the most versatile avatar. In this game, Bernard�s Maniac Mansion cohorts are gone, but he does have two companions in a quest that spans three eras of time (Grossman and Schafer). Each character is trapped in a different era after the opening sequence of the game, but able to communicate through the sending of supplies flushed through the time-traveling port-a-potties. One of Bernard�s companions is a woman named Laverne, a medical student with an interest in dissecting hamsters. She is portrayed as eccentric, with messy hair, unfashionable yet 
adventure games 43
unique clothing, and eyes that don�t match. She is for the most part no one�s love interest, the exception being one tentacle who finds her attractive while she is wearing a disguise. This is an early example of progressive gender representations in adventure games by comparisons to other computer game genres, a distinction I return to when I address the King�s Quest avatars in chapter 3.  Another example of the golden-era adventure game avatar is seen in another LucasArts game, The Secret of Monkey Island (1990). Throughout the series, the lead character is a classic ditz: blond hair, more beauty than brains, and big, unrealized ambitions. This character is, however, male, and he is constantly in pursuit of both his dreams of being a �mighty pirate� and the would-be love of his life, island governor Elaine Marley�a woman who is always portrayed as more successful, levelheaded, and intelligent than the male avatar, Guybrush Threepwood. Elaine Marley begins the series running for the office of governor, and throughout is shown pursuing and achieving that goal while granting Guybrush the time of day only when her own ambitions are met (Gilbert, Secret of Monkey Island). The player thus occupies the role of the bumbling fool, playing an avatar that no one respects. Making progress in Guybrush�s quest is difficult because of his low standing in the community, and the player may find additional motivation in the continual heckling of nonplayer character bystanders. However humiliating the role, the quest for attention, and for self-transformation from social outsider to �mighty pirate,� is one the player can easily identify with. These avatars and their goals are parodies of the heroic quest, set against not only other adventure games of the time but other heroic characters from media. These characteristics began to establish the adventure game avatars as human characters, rather than less relatable ideals (as best embodied in Tomb Raider�s Lara Croft and Doom�s grimacing space marine). In another Sierra franchise set not in a distant time but instead in a relatively modern urban life, Leisure Suit Larry of the series of the same name is a badly dressed man with sex on his agenda. The player guiding him in this quest experiences the same frustration as the character when Larry fails, as he usually does, to attract the attention of any of the women who see him coming. Larry is another case of the undesirable 
chapter two 44
avatar: his quest is hindered by his own inept and off-putting nature (Lowe, Leisure Suit Larry). The player embodying this avatar is hardly living a dream life, but instead is taking on a quest of desperation. Already, the adventure game genre avatars are positioned as something other than wish fulfillment: these avatars possess no abilities beyond that of the player. Playing this kind of avatar means taking the moral position that one�s own goals and ends are more important than honesty or respect for women, but the entire experience is situated within an environment of humor and lighthearted mockery that gives these actions less meaning. Contrast this with the machismo of the first-person shooter, with Duke Nukem (1991) shouting, �It�s time to kick ass and chew bubble gum. And I�m all out of gum.� Notably, both Larry and Guybrush Threepwood have seen a post�golden age rebirth in commercial projects aimed across platforms, something I revisit in chapter 7.
adventure �games�?
 Players enter any of these adventure games with an introductory sequence that introduces them to the persona of a specific character as part of enabling a literal out-of-body experience of an entirely different life, that of the avatar. Thus a player of adventure games cannot expect to have much control over the start-up of the game, when the stage is set for the predetermined narrative. This reliance on a set of standard expectations is true of any genre: with the first-person shooter, for instance, players expect that an interface will be provided and explained to allow for navigation and shooting. With the adventure game, the required interface needs to allow for the completion of the quest. The crucial characteristic of the adventure game is the presence of the quest. It motivates progression: the avatar has a quest or objective to complete that the player assists the avatar in achieving. This narrative structure creates the expectation of a final victory: when the quest is finished, the player expects the game to come to a conclusion and reveal its meaning.  The genre of the adventure game has standards to aid the player in identifying and engaging with the quest. First, the player can interact with the environment presented on screen. These interactions take 
adventure games 45
many forms, but the primary interaction is usually with nonplayer characters. Nonplayer characters are controlled by the computer; they are graphically represented in the same style as the avatar, but there is no person behind their actions. Often these characters are stationary, waiting for the player to enter the scene and activate their roles. They offer programmed responses, and usually serve as quest givers and objects of quests. The player can speak with nonplayer characters through the avatar. Sometimes the player has a choice of what to say, and in other games the dialogue is preset. This situation again offers a window into the tension between avatar and player: the player may have a choice of what to say, but those choices are determined by the avatar character�s personality and situation�the player does not have absolute power. The game sometimes puts words in the player�s mouth, leaving him or her bound by the system, unable to say what he or she would choose. Second, the player can interact with objects in the environment. These interactions range from lighting a torch or flipping a light switch to collecting pieces to make a voodoo doll. In the earliest days of adventure games, quests involving objects tended to be quite simple: in one room, there is a locked door; in another room, a key. When the player comes across the key, the avatar can pick it up and place it in the inventory�a virtual space often represented by a backpack that can hold seemingly limitless amounts of virtual things. Objects in this inventory and in the larger world can be used and combined, often through interactions as simple as putting that key in the locked door. More complicated interactions are possible using the same puzzle structures in different combinations, as devices can be constructed with objects to solve puzzles�for instance, for the aforementioned voodoo doll the player might collect hair, cloth, and thread from different places, then put these objects together, one after another, to create a voodoo doll. That doll might then be used to torture a particular person and so on through a sequence of events. The options for using objects allow the player to interact with and alter the world of the game, and to thus be part of the environment itself. The mechanics and frameworks governing the potential abilities of the character are rules taken from narrative, not from structures inherent in gameplay. Given these constructions, it is easier to see how adventure 
chapter two 46
games fit under an extended definition of interactive fiction and are not necessarily best understood under the rubric of �games.� In Pause & Effect, Mark Stephen Meadows refers to this kind of work as interactive narrative: �An �interactive narrative� is a form of narrative that allows someone other than the author to affect, choose, or change the events of the plot� (238). The positioning of adventure games within this category depends somewhat on the design principles at work in any given game, as often an adventure game is structured along fairly set lines in a nodal progression; the difference that two different users have in playing the game is in the ordering of events, not in the events themselves. Because of this progression, some adventure games qualify as what Meadows terms an �impositional interactive narrative�: �A heavily designed story, such as one of the 1980�s Choose Your Own Adventure books . . . it guides you with strict sets of individual rules that only allow the reader a narrow margin of decisions� (63). Adventure games do commonly display elements of this definition: choices are set, and the user must follow the path or abandon the game. But as the previous discussion of the CYOA noted, the narrow limits of these gamebooks were imposed in part by the limits of bound codex as database for a decision-making system. Digital systems can allow for more �twisty little passages� within the story even as they also impose rules and structures. At the other extreme are what Meadows calls �expressive games,� which rely �less on the series of events and [behave]s more like architecture: The visitor is allowed to roam freely, explore, investigate, and make changes in the environment. The specifics of a narrative plot are far less defined and, as a result, the breadth of interactivity is much wider� (63). Expressive games include some of the progeny of adventure gaming and role-playing games, such as massive multiplayer online games like the early LucasArts game Habitat and its successors, Everquest and World of Warcraft. In these games, the idea that the user is part of a story is still present; however, what is far more important to the game-playing experience is the building of a consistent world experience. Adventure games can fall in different spaces on the spectrum, from expressive to impositional. Lurking somewhere near the middle are adventure games such as the classic Myst from 1993, wherein the player explores a world with great freedom and little guidance. Certain actions 
adventure games 47
would gradually reveal more of the environment and the overarching storyline. Myst was a success not only with habitual players of computer games but also with a wide audience, in part because people found the exploration of the environment engaging and intuitive�visual and musical cues prompt player involvement. The authors in this case were successful in creating an interactive narrative that Meadows would say creates accessibility for the reader, one of the great challenges of the genre: �The author of interactive narrative has to present all the forking paths by telescoping information and offering perspective. So the art of interactive narrative lies in the author�s ability to simultaneously imagine (and illustrate) each of these views and make all of them accessible for the reader� (69). That is a challenge that textual works inherently handle differently than digital works, as the very format of the physical page constrains any notion of �forking paths,� while digital space enables infinite diversions. Myst�s environment, as shown in plate 2, literally embodies forking paths on its twisting island as rendered in early 3-D graphics and textures. In Myst, the epic scale and beautiful environments gradually tell the story, giving it a feeling of mythic significance. In games like those that LucasArts produces, the scale is less epic and more personal and the focus more comic, as with Day of the Tentacle�s (1993, DOS/Mac OS) highly cartoon-influenced graphics and �Purple Tentacle� villain. The constant switching of perspective between Day of the Tentacle�s three playable characters further requires a story that takes an omniscient view, as the narrative often demands the display of events outside the knowledge of the user�s avatar, or at least outside of the knowledge of one or the other of the characters, given the spatial difference in their individual perspectives. This omniscient perspective is also reinforced by the graphical decision to place the characters controlled by the user on the screen, rather than having the screen reflect what that character sees. Adventure games can thus simultaneously draw on approaches from multiple media in their use of perspective; as Meadows notes: �Perspective is odd because it�s something that exists both visually and cognitively. . . . It exists in the form of a first- and second-person perspective in literature and has visual equivalents in painting, architecture, and interface design� (162). This is another way in which the internal convergence 
chapter two 48
of media influences is expressed in interactive narratives in general and adventure games in particular.
transmedia storytelling
 Several early adventure games externalized this relationship with literature and other texts. I addressed this in adaptations such as the textbased games The Hobbit and The Hitchhiker�s Guide to the Galaxy, discussed in chapter 1. But adaptation is only one relationship a game can have with texts: some games go beyond the existing narrative. Releases where the game experience extends the experience of an existing narrative world are examples of the �transmedia storytelling environment� as Henry Jenkins defined it, in which the story of a world is not contained in any one media product (�Game Design�). Jenkins offered the example of Star Wars: �The Star Wars game may not simply retell the story of Star Wars [the film], but it doesn�t have to in order to enrich or expand our experience of the Star Wars saga. We already know the story before we even buy the game and would be frustrated if all it offered us was a regurgitation of the original film experience. Rather, the Star Wars game exists in dialogue with the films, conveying new narrative experiences through its creative manipulation of environmental details� (�Game Design�). These new narrative experiences can range from games centered on particular characters related to the primary Star Wars (film and book) canon whose stories were not part of the Star Wars saga to the experience of players within the massive multiplayer games Star Wars Galaxies (2003, Windows PC) or Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011, Windows PC), who shape stories by adding their own characters to the universe.  In a transmedia environment, one can experience any iteration of the story�for instance, a Star Wars movie or adventure game�independently, but one will discover more of the story by indulging across media platforms: �One can imagine games taking their place within a larger narrative system with story information communicated through books, film, television, comics, and other media, each doing what it does best, each a relatively autonomous experience, but the richest understanding of the story world coming to those who follow the narrative across the 
adventure games 49
various channels� (Jenkins, �Game Design�). In the Star Wars series, the books might feature a highly developed historical saga and introduce the stories of new important characters, while flight simulator�style games such as TIE Fighter and X-Wing offer the opportunity to share the experience of a soldier in the armies in conflict throughout the films. In these cases, each medium offers a different strength: while it would be possible to write a book around the battles of a Tie Fighter pilot, the game offers the same reflex challenges as piloting and a chance to mimic the experience of the pilot through actions rather than words. Conversely, the game cannot offer the narrative complexity and depth of information provided in a novel. Through this interaction of experiences the world of Star Wars is fleshed out, creating the possibility for a fuller experience of the narrative through varied ways of joining the universe.  The connection between adventure games and more traditional narrative forms in transmedia storytelling universes continued even as graphics were gradually integrated into the parser-based model of interactive fiction. Reading and playing continued to be related pursuits. In 1993, Companions of Xanth (MS-DOS) was released by Legend Entertainment Company bundled with a physical book by Piers Anthony. The book, Demons Don�t Dream, offers one detailed possibility for the outcome of the quests of two characters playing a computer game that transports them into the land of Xanth, a fantastical world that is in some ways an alternate Florida where almost everyone has magical powers of some sort. The book plays out a literal transformation of player into avatar, as the two protagonists gradually realize that Xanth is not a computer-generated construct but a real world (Anthony). The players enter the world of Xanth once they come to believe in it and care about the fate of its inhabitants, though they initially believe them to be only characters in a computer game. Companions of Xanth offers only one playable character, Dug, but includes a nonplayer character companion who accompanies the character on the quest as a guide and potential ally (Alpin par. 3). The interface system in Companions of Xanth uses a verb-based model and offers text descriptions that echo some of Piers Anthony�s own style of description to accompany the images. In the book, many puns rely on subtleties of language, such as the similarity of sound between �pale� and �pail�:

 �And where may I find this magical solution?� �It is beyond the pail.� �Beyond the pale,� Dug said. �Of course.� �You must take the pail and bring the solution back in it. That is the only way.� �I shall try to do that. But just how far beyond the pale, uh pail, is this solution?� (Anthony 43)
 Within the game, the humor is visual. The player encounters a pail sitting in the path, and acquires it to hold the �solution� after it is brewed through solving another puzzle. However, the emphasis on verbal humor and exchanges with characters is minimized, leaving players to sort out the puns for themselves.  Another company, Cyberdreams, published a game based on a Harlan Ellison short story written in 1967: �I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream.� Ellison was directly connected to the production, writing the story in a longer version specifically for the adventure game of the same name (1995, DOS/Mac OS). He was also the voice of the supercomputer manipulating the fates of the playable characters (Mobygames). The game was particularly unusual in that it was essentially impossible to win in any real sense, although the five victims endured some fates that were more desirable than others (Ellison, Mullich, and Sears). Staying true to Ellison�s vision, the game dealt with themes of sanity and human failings in intensely psychological gameplay. As one reviewer wrote:
Each of the characters in the game is afflicted with a distinct psychological condition (paranoia, depression, etc.) and his or her actions are affected by these tendencies. Each character�s scenario is basically constructed to subject each of them [to] whatever traumatic experiences caused these afflictions and forces them to explore the nature of their humanity and find a way to deal with and overcome their fears. These forays into each character�s psyche can only be described as disturbing as best, with images ranging from people impaled on meat hooks to mutilated children in a Nazi concentration camp. (Hoelscher)

These images indicate that Cyberdreams intentionally targeted an adult audience with the game; for the images to exercise their full power, players must understand them and have a strong reaction to them. For a child, these images would mainly serve to horrify. For an adult, they facilitate an exploration of darkness in the human psyche.  As part of a growing landscape of transmedia storytelling, adventure games suggest an expanded definition of interactive narrative. The juxtaposition of the early adventure game elements with the wider realm of electronic literature demonstrates the potential of interactive narrative as a primary form rather than as a set of binaries in conflict with one another. The much-debated conflict between interactivity and narrative, like that between ludology and narratalogy, also occurs in discussions of the adventure game, as I�ve shown, and while as Moulthrop notes it is out of style, the formal tensions remain. It can appear that although these games offer narratives, they are always secondary to the demands of interactivity, since the user is confronted not with a written linear text but with a screen, an interface, a host of characters, and a perspective that differs from game to game. The most important thing about an adventure game is that it must be playable. Playing a game implies an interaction that reading a text does not. A closely related type of criticism is that the stories in computer games are not �literary.� In part such comments stem from the assumption that the only good story is a singular, unchanging one to be read. However, computer game stories must be designed to work as part of a whole, subject to interactions of the user. The balance varies across the genre: greater openness comes at the expense of the planned story, while a planned story requires limiting the user�s freedom. But what if the user�s freedom is not ultimately the goal? What happens when games and fans instead build upon the model suggested by Andrew Plotkin�s interactive fiction Shade, which deploys interactivity as a tool for the construction of narrative and meaning rather than as an end in itself? Janet Murray notes that the adventure game worked from its roots to create a feeling of agency: �The adventure maze embodies a classic fairytale narrative of danger and salvation. Its lasting appeal as both a story and a game pattern derives from the melding of a cognitive problem (finding the path) with an emotionally symbolic pattern (facing what is 
chapter two 52
frightening and unknown)� (130). During the golden era, the adventure game was still limited by the fairy-tale expectations brought to the game format�the stories resolve happily, the quest through the maze ends with an escape. While the player enjoys a feeling of agency, that feeling is hindered by the foreknowledge of the happily-ever-after ending. These patterns were dominant in the classic model of adventure games but also played a role in setting the stage for the next generation of stories. As players stepped into the shoes of adventure game characters, and became coproducers both of the game experience and of the games as part of transmedia, many brought the same cocreative spirit as Terry Phillips used when breathing life into Raistlin Majere�and these first steps would shape the longer journey of the genre to follow.
